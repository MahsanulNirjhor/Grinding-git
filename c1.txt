Head : It is the currently checked out commit.

Detaching Head means checking out to commit.
Rather than Branch.

git rebase <Branch name>: we rebase the commits from the <Branch name> to the current branch.

git reset HEAD~<number>: It resets the changes to the specified commit.

git cherry-pick <commit name>: paste the commit to the current branch.

git revert HEAD

git rebase -i HEAD~<range of commits> : 
    1. dd = cut, p = paste for reordering.
    2. latest commit is in the last place
